## What did I learn

This was my first project using <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="al-link al-link-focus">Svelte</a> so I learned a lot on how to build apps with it.

After using Svelte I am super impressed and love it very much.

I also learned a lot about how to keep more complicated values (such as Objects or Lists) in local storage. My solution: convert the object into a JSON string then store that string. When you want the value back, simply use the built-in JSON decoding function.
